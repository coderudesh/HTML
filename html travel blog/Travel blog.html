        <h3>How to Reach Here:</h3>
        <p>Considering Delhi as the starting point, the first milestone to cross would be Haridwar. Tungnath is 200 kilometers away from here.</p>
        <h4>Delhi - Haridwar –  Rishikesh –  Devprayag –  Srinagar –  Rudraprayag –  Agastyamuni –  Kund/Sari –  Ukhimath –  Chopta – Tungnath.</h4>

        <h3>Why Tungnath:</h3>
        <p>The Himalayas with its rich flora and fauna is a treat to the sore eyes. Even though I’ve been to treks before, this was one of the longest treks especially through a section of a wildlife sanctuary.</p>

        <h3>Treck:</h3>
        <p>The Tungnath trek is one of the <b>Panch Kedar pilgrimages</b> and is a part of the Chopta Chandrashila trek route. It offers breathtaking views of the surrounding Himalayan peaks and lush green valleys. The trek is moderately challenging and attracts both religious pilgrims and adventure seekers alike.</p>
